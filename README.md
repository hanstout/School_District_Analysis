# School_District_Analysis

# Overview:
For this project, a school district was analyzed to find key information regarding budgets, math and reading scores with findings per school, per grade level, and school type. Comparisons were drawn between school spending and overall passing grades. During the analysis, data from Thomas High School, specifically the 9th grade looked particularly skewed compared to all other school. Due to the concern, the analysis was done removing the grades from 9th grade students at Thomas High School. 
# Results:
The distict summary showed a increase in passing percentage among all 9th graders in the distict because of the removal of the 9th grade values at Thomas High School. In addition, Thomas High School went up in the rankings of top high schools. It was actually higher on the list as it was perviously. Math scores and reading scores were not affected because the 9th grade averages at that high school were void. The scores in addtion to spending also was not greatly affected. The scores by school size and by school type stayed the sane as well. 
# Summary: 
Overall, removing the scores of 9th graders at Thomas High School did not have a huge effect on all aspects of the data but it did in specific categories. The school climbed the rankings in the distrct, the 9th graders overall precentages decreased, student rankings were changed, and passing per school type for 9th grade changed.
